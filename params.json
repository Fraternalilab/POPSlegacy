{"name":"Pops","tagline":"POPS*: solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) of proteins and nucleic acids","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\nPOPS* is a fast algorithm to calculate solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) of proteins and nucleic acids at atomic (default) and residue (coarse-grained) level. Atomic and residue area parameters have been optimised versus an accurate all-atom method (Naccess). Residue areas (coarse-grained) are simulated with a single sphere centered at the C-alpha atom for amino acids and at the P atom for nucleotides.\r\n\r\nAn analytical formula is used for the calculation of solvent accessibilities. The formula is simple, easily derivable and fast to compute, therefore, practical for use in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as an approximation to the first solvation shell. The default output contains: list of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and total contributions to the accessible surface area of the entire molecule (all atoms), first model only.\r\n\r\nAfter submission a holding page provides access to the result page. Otherwise results (also of previous runs) can be accessed through the Retrieve function.\r\n\r\nThe POPS* program code can be downloaded here.\r\nUsers publishing results obtained with the POPS* program should acknowledge its use by citing Fraternali and Cavallo (2002) and for the POPS* server Cavallo et al. (2003).\r\n\r\n# Parameters\r\n\r\nThe optimised parameters are listed here:\r\n\r\n## atom parameters\r\n\r\n## residue parameters (coarse-grained)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Help on Options\r\n\r\n## PDB structure file\r\nEntering a PDB identifier (lower case or upper case without the extension .pdb) in the first text window will automatically perform the POPS* calculation on the corresponding structure. Uploading of structure files by the user can be performed by specifying the file path and name in the second text window. Please ensure that atom and residue names conform to the PDB format.\r\n\r\n## coarse-grained\r\nCalculation of accessible surface area on residue level. \r\n\r\n## probe radius\r\nThe radius of the surface probe (solvent molecule) in Angstrom. \r\n\r\n## multiple models (option currently disabled)\r\nBy default the POPS* calculation will be performed on the first model only, if a structure file containing multiple models is chosen/uploaded. Activation of the 'Multiple models' button triggers POPS* calculation of all models. \r\n\r\n## molecule composition\r\nNumber of chains, standard residues, total residues and atoms. \r\n\r\n## atom types\r\nList of atom types and their POPS* parameters. \r\n\r\n## molecule topology\r\nNumber of bonds, angles, torsions and non-bonded interactions. \r\n\r\n## POPS* area per atom\r\nList of atom areas [A2], number of overlaps and atom grouping (1: positive, 2: negative, 3: polar, 4: aromatic, 5: aliphatic). \r\n\r\n## POPS* area per residue\r\nList of residue areas [A2] (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, total) and number of overlaps. \r\n\r\n## POPS* area per chain\r\nList of chain areas [A2] (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, total). \r\n\r\n## neighbour list\r\nList of neighbours per atom, provided in a separate output file. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Output\r\n\r\n## ATOM SASAs\r\nAtomNr : atom number in molecular coordinate file\r\nAtomNe : atom name in molecular coordinate file\r\nResidNe : residue name in molecular coordinate file\r\nChain : chain name in molecular coordinate file (can be void)\r\nResidNr : residue number in molecular coordinate file\r\nSASA/A^2 : solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nQ(SASA) : quotient of SASA and Surf (below), i.e. the fraction of SASA\r\nN(overl) : number of overlaps with atom neighbours\r\nAtomTp : atom type code (GROMOS van der Waals atom type)\r\nAtomGp : atom group code: positive=1, negative=2, polar=3, aromatic=4, aliphatic=5\r\nSurf/A^2 : surface area of isolated atom\r\n\r\n## RESIDUE SASAs\r\nResidNe : residue name in molecular coordinate file\r\nChain : chain name in molecular coordinate file (can be void)\r\nResidNr : residue number in molecular coordinate file\r\nPhob/A^2 : hydrophobic solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nPhil/A^2 : hydrophilic solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nTotal/A^2 : total solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nQ(SASA) : quotient of SASA and Surf (below), i.e. the fraction of SASA\r\nN(overl) : number of overlaps with atom neighbours\r\nSurf/A^2 : surface area of isolated atom\r\n\r\n## CHAIN SASAs\r\nChain : chain number\r\nId : chain name in molecular coordinate file (can be void)\r\nAtomRange : range of atom numbers in chain\r\nResidRange : range of residue numbers in chain\r\nPhob/A^2 : hydrophobic solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nPhil/A^2 : hydrophilic solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nTotal/A^2 : total solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\n\r\n## MOLECULE SASAs\r\nPhob/A^2 : hydrophobic solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nPhil/A^2 : hydrophilic solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\nTotal/A^2 : total solvent accessible surace area in Angstrom^2 units\r\n\r\n# Background Information\r\n\r\nThe area equation is defined by a product Π of terms that estimate the reduction of SASA of atom i by the overlap with its neighbours j (Hasel at al., 1988):\r\n\r\nΠi=1N [ 1 - (pi pij bij(rij) / Si) ].\r\n\r\ni is the atom for which the POPS* area is computed, j is any of N neighbour atoms.\r\npi is an atom type specific SASA parameter.\r\npij is a sphere overlap parameter depending on the degree of bonding between i and j (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-(>4)).\r\nbij is a geometric construct based on the radii and distance (rij) of i and j.\r\nSi is the SASA of the free atom i (no neighbours).\r\n\r\nThe atom specific parameters (radii, SASAs) are listed in the Parameters files for the atoms of all standard PDB residues, followed by the connectivity parameters (pij, bij) and the solvent radius for water.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\nFraternali, F. and van Gunsteren, W.F.\r\nAn efficient mean solvation force model for use in molecular dynamics simulations of proteins in aqueous solution.\r\nJournal of Molecular Biology 256 (1996) 939-948.\r\n\r\nFraternali, F. and Cavallo, L.\r\nParameter optimized surfaces (POPS*): analysis of key interactions and conformational changes in the ribosome.\r\nNucleic Acids Research 30 (2002) 2950-2960.\r\n\r\nCavallo, L., Kleinjung, J. and Fraternali, F.\r\nPOPS: A fast algorithm for solvent accessible surface areas at atomic and residue level.\r\nNucleic Acids Research 31 (2003) 3364-3366.\r\n\r\nKleinjung, J. and Fraternali, F.\r\nPOPSCOMP: an automated interaction analysis of biomolecular complexes.\r\nNucleic Acids Research 33 (2005) W342-W346.\r\n\r\nThe POPS server was developed by Franca Fraternali, the POPS logo was designed by Domenico Fraternali.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
