- 1.7.0
Fri Jun  3 11:35:12 BST 2016
	New feature: Output of the buried SASA (bSASA).
	Assuming SASA is calculated for residue 'i',
	bSASA is summed only over side-chain atoms to form bSASA_phil and
	bSASA_phob, depending upon the hydrophilic or hydrophobic
	nature of the contacting atom. bSASA default output is 'popsb.out'.

- 1.6.5
Sat May 28 17:17:42 BST 2016
	Bug fix: Now considering PDB format column
	'27 AChar Code for insertion of residues'.

- 1.6.2
Wed Nov  6 17:48:11 GMT 2013
	Added suggestion if no bonds are found: use '--coarse'.
	Now exiting when the same atom is used for distance calculations because
	of atom clashes. This leads to segmentation faults otherwise.

- 1.6.1
Tue Oct  8 15:15:03 BST 2013
	Bug fix for 20130925: Relative residue SASA returned as 'nan'.
							'neli.out' not linked by web server.

	Modified output headers for consistency.

Wed May  2 18:40:55 BST 2012

	POPS is now under Git control.
	Created branch 'trajectory'.

	Added trajectory input. A GROMOS96 trajectory is provided with switch --traj
	and POPS* is performed on each frame. The total SASA output is listed
	in pops.traj.out.

- 1.3.2 : released
Tue Mar 15 16:38:37 GMT 2011
	Command line argument rProbe was not used in program, but the constant_sasa
	value instead. Fixed that, but segmentation faults appeared for rProbe > 4.
	Increased allocation of topol->neighbourState and topol->neighbourPar
	to 1024 and added assertion '< 1024' to neighbour list construction.

- 1.3.1 : released 07.03.11

Thu Oct 21 08:26:45 BST 2010
	Added check for non-standard residue types for all ATOM entries,
	not only for CA/P atoms.

Thu Jan 21 13:20:44 GMT 2010
	Added GROMOS atom types to 'atomgroup_data.h'.
	Added output file name to stdout.

Fri Dec 11 13:42:24 GMT 2009
	Added external variable 'status' which is the return value of 'main', 
	to indicate 0=error-free, -1=warning or 1=error.

- 1.2.3

	Modified default behaviour for short atoms.
Fri Dec  4 12:19:49 GMT 2009

	Ticket #6 'POPSc fails with DNA : 1DSZ.pdb'
	PDB format 3.0 defines DNA residues as DC, DG, DA, DT, DU and DI and
	replaces the '*' in saccharide atom names with '''.
	Added residues DI (2'-DEOXYINOSINE-5'-MONOPHOSPHATE) and I (INOSINIC ACID).
	Residue DN and N seem to be obsolete, but are kept for backward compatibility.
	Added residue definitions for unknown polymer residue UNK and
	unknown ligand residue UNL.

Wed Dec  3 00:10:04 GMT 2008
	Ticket#3 'nan' result for ASTRAL-SCOP domains 
	'd1bd8__' and 'd1gsma1'. This is caused by too short atom distances, which
	create 'circular' diheder angles. Addded error handling for that case: 
	"Problematic conformation at atom 1168
	Error: Check input structure for too short atom distances!"
	Exits with error code 1.
